iOS Widgets Framework
==================

The URX iOS Widgets Framework is a collection of UI widgets to help you quickly integrate the URX App Search API into your app.

Installation
------------
**Step 1: Add the URXSearch and URXWidgets Frameworks to your Project**:
First, [download the zip for the latest release tag](https://github.com/URXtech/urx-widgets-ios/releases). Then in Xcode, drag and drop the URXSearch.framework, URXWidgets.framework, and URXWidgetsResources.framework into your project navigator to link the frameworks.

**Step 2: Set up the API Key**:
Before you can use the SDK, you must provide your URX API Key. To do this, add a `String` row to your Info.plist file with ``URX API Key`` as the key and your API key as the value. Contact support@urx.com for an API key if you don't already have one.

**Step 3: Set -ObjC linker flag**:
In your project's Build Settings, make sure to add -ObjC in the "Other Linker Flags" setting.
